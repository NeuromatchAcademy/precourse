1. The smallest value of dt results in the best numerical integration (most similar
   to the analytical solution)

2. We have to compute the area of more rectangles.

3. Here we used the forward Riemann sum, and it results in an underestimate of the
   integral for positive values of $T$ and underestimate for negativeve values of
   $T$. We could also use the backward Riemann sum, and that will give an overestimate
   of the integral for positive values of $T$.
