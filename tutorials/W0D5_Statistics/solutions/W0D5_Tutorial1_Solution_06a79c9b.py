1) The limits of the histogram at 0 and 10, as these are the minimum and maximum
number of trials that a rat can turn left out of 10 trials.

2) The shape seems symmetric and is centered around 5.

3) An average/mean around 5 left turns out of 10 trials indicates that the rat
chose left and right turns in the maze with equal probability (that p = 0.5)

4) With p = 0.8, the center of the histogram would be at x = 8 and it would not be
   as symmetrical (since it would be cut off at max 10). You can go into the code above
   and run it with p = 0.8 to see this.
