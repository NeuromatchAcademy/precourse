1)  The first transformation is a horizontal expansion. You can see that b doesn't
    change length, while a grows longer. Since these eigenvectors are aligned
    with the axes, we know that there is no movement in the vertical direction
    (based on b) and an expansion in the horizontal direction (based on a).

2)  This transformation is a reflection over the line y = x. Neither eigenvector
    changes length, a is along the line y = x and b is flipped over it.
