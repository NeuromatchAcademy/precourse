# Code of Conduct Investigation Process 

Please see Code of Conduct (CoC) here: https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

## Code of Conduct violations fall into three categories. 
1. **Level 1**: Minor. Likely resolvable via conversations & mediation between complainant and/or accused, with no formal action needed.
2. **Level 2**: Moderate. Potentially resolvable, but formal mediation or consequence is required.
3. **Level 3**: Egregious and unresolvable (e.g. documented abuse or harassment)

If a report is received about behavior that violates the Neuromatch CoC, the following steps will be taken. In all cases, the identity of the complainant shall be kept confidential whenever necessary.
1. The OMBUDs office will investigate. Investigations are documented in written form either on Discord and/or Slack, and in a private OMBUDs folder.
2. The OMBUDs office will categorize the complaint into one of the three categories above based on the outcome of the investigation.
3. If Level 1 or Level 2, the Ombuds office will attempt to resolve the issue by informing other members of the NM community on an as-needed basis.
    - Level 1: Speak with all parties individually or together (complainant, others involved, and accused as relevant) and potentially set up a mediation session or other intervention between complainant and accused if appropriate. Follow up to check in on outcomes after closure of issue.
    - Level 2: Speak with all parties individually (complainant, others involved, and accused as relevant) to hear both sides of the story and decide on consequences acceptable to all parties to resolve the issue.
4. If a resolution cannot be achieved via Step 3, or if the investigation concludes that the violation is Level 3, the offender will be removed from NM without the chance to defend their actions via whichever of the following is necessary, in the following order. 
    - Remove from Google Drive
    - Remove from Slack
      - Inform at least one Slack admin about the ban
    - Switch zoom account credentials/permalinks to remove access
    - Remove from Discord
      - “Ban” from server
      - Remove from authorization email list
      - Inform Discord helpdesk personnel about the ban so the person cannot rejoin and support tickets will be ignored
    - Send official email from OMBUDs member informing them of the ban and reasons for it.


## Academic Integrity Violations 


If it is found that a student has impersonated another student in order to gain access to the interactive track…

2. If the impersonation was done with the knowledge and consent of the Impersonatee, both the Impersonator and Impersonatee will be removed from NM and banned from future participation in NM for a period of time to be determined by the OMBUDs office.
