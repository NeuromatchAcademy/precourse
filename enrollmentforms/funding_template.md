We encourage you to ask your organization for help in funding your training program. Here is an example message that you could send to your supervisor, department head, or manager to start the conversation. 


“I’ve been accepted as a 2022 student in Neuromatch Academy (NMA), a three week immersive summer course in computational neuroscience/machine learning. I will be taught by the world leaders in the field and will gain skills that will make me better at my work. Can our organization pay my registration fee?”
