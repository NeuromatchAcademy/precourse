# Neuromatch Academy wants to learn how we can improve our program even more! 

**We would love your help with this!**

We will be sending you surveys periodically throughout your course so we can learn what is working and what should be improved in future years. We want to be able to analyze these data, which can include getting help from research teams who are experts outside Neuromatch. **Any data we want to share with these outside research teams will be “de-identified”, meaning that your name and other identifying information (like your email address) will be removed so that your answers and data remain anonymous.** 

The types of data we want to analyze are:
1. Your **anonymized** answers to surveys about your experiences at Neuromatch Academy (e.g., Which tutorials did you like the most? Are you getting along with your pod-mates and TA?)
2. Your **anonymized** answers to content-based questions so we can measure how much you are learning from the tutorials (e.g., What are the situations in which you would use PCA?)
3. Your **anonymized** transcripts from your zoom sessions with your pod so we can learn how you interact with your podmates, so we can optimize the pod-matching process and otherwise learn how best to make NMA work for everybody. No video or audio will be recorded! This will only be automatic voice-to-text zoom transcripts.

Your participation in these surveys and other data collection is of course **completely voluntary**! But, if you are comfortable, we hope you will help us improve NMA for future students and TAs. There is no direct benefit or harm to you in sharing this anonymized data, but you would get to say you helped create some really neat data for future research. And even if you don’t want to share your **anonymized data**, we hope you will still participate in these voluntary surveys, because they really help us improve NMA for everybody.

**Do you agree to let us share your anonymized data with a research team outside Neuromatch?** Remember, **your name and other identifying information will be removed** before it is shared anywhere outside the Neuromatch organization, so only information from your survey responses, zoom transcripts, and anonymized demographic information (like your language preferences, educational background, or country of residence) will be sent to any outside research team.

## **PLEASE INDICATE YOUR ANSWER IN THE AIRTABLE FORM.**

We’re excited to have you join us at NMA! Welcome!
