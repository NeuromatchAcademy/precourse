# Academy Student Expectations (7-9 hours per day, Monday-Friday)

Academy courses are designed to be intensely interactive and engaging. You should plan to have a lot of time to devote to the course each weekday for the duration of the course. Try not to schedule other major intellectual activities during the course to allow yourself time to rest and reflect on what you have been learning.  This document outlines what your roles and responsibilities will be as a student.  


As a student, you will bring your own expertise into the course and this determines in part what you will learn. Students who have less experience with a given skill set, especially Python, will find some parts of the course very challenging. This is normal, and you should not feel too frustrated, especially after the first two days. Our courses are meant to provide a high level introduction to many parts of the subject. We do not expect you to have mastery over every day of content. You can always go back and revisit the material again after the course is over, weeks, months or even years from now. The tutorials and videos will be available online for as long as you need them.  


As an Academy student you will be expected to:


-    Be present for every day of the Academy in your designated time slots.  This consists of two parts:
     -    Attend the tutorial with your pod and TAs (approximately 4.5 hours with a 1 hour break in the middle)
     -    Attend the project time slot with members of the pod for 2-3 hours each day in addition to the tutorial session. You do have the option to opt out of projects to focus exclusively on tutorials if needed. 
     - You can see our full attendance policy [here](https://docs.neuromatch.io/p/BI_ssrrHYrfg_E/Academy-Student-Attendance-Policy-and-Waivers). 
-    Review materials for the course prior to the start of each day’s tutorial.  This could be an intro lecture for you to watch, or something to read. 
-    Actively work with other students in small groups to discuss lecture materials, tutorials, and to develop your group’s project
-    We will use the Discord.com platform to communicate with each other. This is a great way to expand your network of contacts and to meet other students.  [If you are located in a region where Discord is blocked, we have worked to implement regional alternatives].
-    Let the TA know if you need to miss classes due to illness/other unavoidable circumstances. 
-    Be respectful and understanding of cultural differences. Please review the [code of conduct](https://docs.neuromatch.io/p/BI_ssrrHYrfg_E/Academy-Student-Attendance-Policy-and-Waivers).
-    Complete 5 min daily reflection surveys to help you think about the course material and provide anonymous feedback on how your day went working within your pod.
-    Refresh your knowledge of or learn the prerequisite Python, math, and any other course-specific topics. See the qualifications section below for more information. 
-    Pay your registration fee. Most students are able to get their registration fee paid for by their institution or employer, typically through a reimbursement program for additional training. If you don’t know how to approach this, we provide an instruction guide in our payment portal. Because payment is made through our payment portal, we cannot accept bank transfers directly from your institution. As always, the payment process in our portal will ensure that Neuromatch is affordable to you or your institution.

Remember most importantly that this Academy is what you make it.  Our curriculum is designed to work best for active learning, so you should support your fellow students, ask questions of the TA, be an active participant in your group. Make new friends on Discord. You’ll also be able to build your network of contacts, with your TA, other students, and the instructional faculty and mentors for your group project or in other sessions. Create opportunities to engage, learn, and build connections! The Academy is an immersive, intense experience, and we know you will have a fantastic time!


## Qualifications for Computational Neuroscience Course
- Some understanding of neuroscience. 
     - We strongly recommend going through the neuro video series before the course (W0D0 [here]( https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/))
- Some experience with Python, including relevant Python libraries (numpy, scipy and sklearn). 
     - We strongly recommend you go through the pre-reqs refresher Python days (W0D1 and W0D2 [here]( https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/))
     - We also include other resources to learn Python on our [Prerequisites and Preparatory Materials page](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse/blob/main/prereqs/ComputationalNeuroscience.md).
-  Basic knowledge in linear algebra, probability, statistics, and calculus. 
     - We strongly recommend going through our refreshers on linear algebra, calculus, and statistics (W0D3, W0D4, W0D5 [here]( https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/))
Please consult our [CN Prerequisites and Preparatory Materials page](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse/blob/main/prereqs/ComputationalNeuroscience.md) for more information and suggestions on how to prepare.

## Qualifications for Deep Learning Course
-    Experience with Python, including relevant Python libraries (numpy, scipy and sklearn). 
     - We strongly recommend going through the Python pre-reqs refresher developed for the comp neuro course: W0D1 and W0D2 [here]( https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/)). Note that it has a neuroscience focus in the examples used but the Python basics will be extremely useful for the deep learning course. 
     - We also include other resources to learn Python on our [Prerequisites and Preparatory Materials page](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse/blob/main/prereqs/DeepLearning.md).
-   Basic knowledge in Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Calculus. 
     - We strongly recommend going through the math pre-reqs refresher developed for the comp neuro course: W0D3, W0D4, and W0D5 [here]( https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/)) Note that these have a neuroscience focus in the examples used but the math basics will be extremely useful for the deep learning course. 
     - We also include other resources to learn math on our [Prerequisites and Preparatory Materials page](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse/blob/main/prereqs/DeepLearning.md).

## Qualifications for Computational Tools for Climate Science

-   Minimum experience with Python. Students will be offered asynchronous support during the Python pre-course (July 12-14) on topics drawn from the Project Pythia Foundations book ["Python-based computing in the geosciences"](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html): 
     - Overview 
     - Numpy
     - Matplotlib
     - Cartopy
     - Datetime
     - Pandas
     - Data formats
-  Go to our [**Prerequisites and Preparatory Materials page**](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse/blob/main/prereqs/ClimateScience.md) to refresh your foundational knowledge in programming, math, and science.


## Qualifications for NeuroAI 
- Have taken Neuromatch courses in computational neuroscience and deep learning, or the equivalent
- Have intermediate proficiency in Python
- Some core math concepts
- Go to our [Prerequisites Page](https://neuroai.neuromatch.io/prereqs/NeuroAI.html) in the course book for additional details and resources. 


## Evaluations:

There will be a few questionnaires that we would like you to complete before, during, and after the course in order to gauge learning outcomes. This is not a form of grading, or a test. We’d just like to know how much you have learned in the course. These also help us demonstrate how our courses work to people or organizations that might donate money to Neuromatch to help pay for TAs, so we hope you will help us keep Neuromatch Academy accessible to everyone by filling them out honestly and completely! Thank you! 

**Completion of the precourse survey, daily surveys, and postcourse survey are required to access your certificate.**
