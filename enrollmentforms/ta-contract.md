# Neuromatch Teaching Assistant Contract 
TAs for Neuromatch Academy are expected to guide the students’ through the Academy by facilitating their learning experience. As such, TAs are learning coaches, more than teachers. This means that they do not have to be an expert in the taught materials; a high-level understanding of the materials and goals (such as provided during training sessions and the solution materials of the tutorials) is sufficient to be a good “tutor” in the sense of the problem-based learning (PBL) philosophy.

TAs are required to be respectful and understanding of differences in students’ expertise and cultural differences. Please review the [code of conduct](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Role
- TAs will make sure that students progress well in the tutorial material. As problem-based learning “tutors”, you will
- Provide support, empathy and inspiration
Facilitate thinking, growth and engagement
Guide students to answers rather than directly giving them answers
With questions such as “did you consider [this]?”

*Lead TAs* have additional responsibilities. These include advising TAs, managing TA absences, and guiding less experienced TAs on content. 

## General Qualifications
- Good python programming skills

### Computational Neuroscience & Deep Learning Qualifications: 
- Experience with the relevant python libraries (numpy, scipy and sklearn)
    - math/python resources here: https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse. 
- Minimum 2-years of experience in computational neuroscience and/or machine learning
- Some exposure to neuroscience concepts
    - If you are new to neuroscience, we will have precourse material on neuroscience that is *mandatory* for you to watch (~2 hours of content). We also recommend watching videos 1.1-1.6 and 2.1-2.4 from this [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience). Here is also a [short read on neuroscience](https://www.bna.org.uk/static/uploads/resources/BNA_English.pdf).

### Computational Tools for Climate Science: 
- Experience with the relevant python libraries (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Cartopy, Datetime, Dataformats)
    - Python resources can be found through [Project Pythia](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/overview.html).
- Minimum 2-years of experience in climate science
- Knowledge in physics, chemistry, and statistics.


## Academy expectations (July 10-28  for Comp Neuro and Deep Learning, July 17-28 for Comp Tools for Climate Science); 7-8h / day)
- Regular TAs are expected to:
    - Prepare for each day's material (i.e., go through the tutorials, be prepared to explain important concepts in the tutorials, be prepared to guide students through exercises if needed, be prepared to explain exercises to students if they are stuck)
    - Accompany students during the 4.5-h lecture/tutorial modules every day during coursework time. 
    - Meet for 1h/group/day for project-related guidance during the projects time. 
- Project TAs are expected to: 
    - Prepare to help with data set and proejct understanding by fully looking over the materials
    - Work in several projects times and spend about 1 hour/group/day for project-related guidance
- [See times here.](https://neuromatchacademy.github.io/widgets/tz.html)

### Mandatory TA training (July 5 & 6, ~2h /day live on Zoom, additional ~6 hours asynchronously)
We will train TAs in the following:
- Tutorial materials: so they know the ins and outs of the solutions
- Tutoring: so they know how to facilitate their students’ independent learning instead of just providing answers
- Training on online tools for teaching
- [See times here.](https://neuromatchacademy.github.io/widgets/tz.html)
- *Lead TAs will have additional mandatory training.*

### Evaluations
TA pods will be evaluated every day during the course with very short (~2 questions) surveys. This is to make sure that pods are coherent and to ensure that TAs are able to teach the course. Not just TAs will be evaluated here, students will also be able to evaluate other students in terms of their cooperative attitude and their potential disruptiveness. For a subset of pods, with the permission of the TAs and the students, we will save transcripts of the pod discussions on each day for the purpose of improving NMA in future years (no audio or video will be recorded, just automatic voice-to-text transcripts).

## Payment: 
We have some resources to help you understand how hiring and payment work.
- Questions about how you can be paid based on your institution, country, or legal status can largely be answered by this [flowchart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cXZf7PHJpd5rrf6R6gIC0vEA4ZsGoMDqr6H_S_N_2AI/edit).
- Questions about payment logistics (bank account information etc.) can largely be answered in this [“How do I get paid?” document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vOR772U5XKBpMkSxH3scwGqXa_laJeqRkrNKnP94g4U/edit?usp=sharing). You will also be redirected to this page after you fill out the TA onboarding agreement. 
- Questions about which tax forms you have to fill out will largely be answered by the dynamic onboarding form. Unfortunately, we cannot help you fill out tax documents, so if you have specific questions about your country or employment status that are not answered by the flowchart or the “How do I get paid?” document, you will need to ask an accountant or someone at your home institution or company.
- If you have gone through all these resources and you still have questions, you can email nma@neuromatch.io and we will get back to you as soon as we can.

**Regular TAs will be paid at the approximate base rate of $550 (USD) per week for service during the course ($1650 stipend total for Comp Neuro and Deep Learning, $1100 for Comp Tools for Climate Science).** 

*Lead TAs receive an additional fixed $550 ($2200 stipend total for Comp Neuro and Deep Learning, $1650 for Comp Tools for Climate Science). 
).* 

We will pay all TAs at the end of the course, but can provide some payment during the course if needed. Please let us know if payment for teaching the course is urgent for you in your current circumstances.
