# Academy's Got Talent 2023 
## Terms & Conditions

Here is some more information for each contest category:

### T-shirt design: 
This year, we want you to bring the spirit of the NMA and CMA communities and share your fun moments through your designs. Design a T-shirt with insider pod jokes, neuromatch and climatematch fun, or anything that brings the academy community together. Do browse the guidelines for T-shirt entries. But remember, this is a community input so don’t spend much time working around the logo. Go for creative designs that point to a moment our community shared with fun, empathy, love, etc. This is your art we want to brag about, not our logo ;)

### Music: 
Pick a topic, merge music genres, get your pod members and academy friends to get their musical instruments and regardless of everything, break the routines and create your own masterpiece rhapsody with computational content. Have you heard our previous winner's songs? Go check it out. Don’t bother yourself too much with recording and video technicality, use anything you have and make your track! But remember that the music videos are encouraged to be related to all things neuroscience or climatescience.  Here is an example from last year: https://www.instagram.com/p/CZcF8PDI6yD/?hl=en

### Photography: 
Pictures of anything related to computational neuroscience, deep learning, and climatescience. We understand that microscope and fluoroscopy images are fancy and beautiful, but everyone may not have access to those; hence, we do not accept those. Scenic, nature pictures are also not accepted for the NMA contest unless related to CN and DL. We expect minimal yet related pictures. Also, writing a little caption of the device you used, where you took it, what the picture is of, and how your picture fit in the topic is very much encouraged, especially for accessibility reasons.

### Comedy: 
This was supposed to be a stand-up (sit-down-behind-your-camera comedy) contest. But if you turn it into a video clip that has science-related comedy content, it is approved. In fact, anything creative in the context of science comedy video is encouraged. However, it cannot be offensive to any person, race, creed, community, or anything or anyone in any manner. Are you thinking that it is a difficult category? You are wrong! Check the comedy channel in the discord for examples.

### Illustration and graphic design: 
Choose a concept or topic related to the academy content and create an image. Imagine that you are designing a poster for your room that shows what DL or computational neuroscience or climatescience is about. What would you design if your lab wanted an original cool poster about your research area? Now find those topics/concepts among our material or daily content, create your work, and send in the illustrations and graphics category.

### Meme making: 
This was one of the most suggested categories to include in this year’s contest. Make a funny meme using different elements. But be careful about two important things, whatever you use for your meme, make sure to not violate copyright (unless it will only be used internally at Neuromatch!) and give appropriate credits. Also, if you are going to joke with someone, use someone’s picture, use their catchphrase, etc. it is necessary to get permission from them. It cannot be offensive to any person, race, creed, community, or anything or anyone in any manner. Here you go, make us laugh! 

### Pod logo design:
Do you have a logo for your pod or group project? In previous years we have had some really fun ones! Show off your design skills and help make an identity for your pod based on your pod name or any other information that will help identify your pod from the rest and make it special! Go pods!

Voting is ONLY through the airtable form (link posted on 28th July). Discord votes are NOT CONSIDERED. 
You agree to transfer all copyright to Neuromatch, Inc., including allowing us to post the entries on public platforms and to publicize them via Neuromatch and Climatematch channels. 
Non-copy-righted materials have to be used. ABSOLUTELY NO graphical, musical, or other elements that the submitting artist doesn't have the rights for can be used. The only exception is that meme graphics are often copyrighted, so it’s okay to use those especially because in most cases they will be shared only internally. 
If your submission is found to violate copyright laws after submission and voting, we may not be able to use it on official merchandise or post it on our website even if it wins a contest. We will remove any content that violates copyright laws from public-facing media upon discovery that such violations have occurred.
Under no circumstances can the NMA or CMA logo be modified. This includes adding shadows, glows, reflections etc.
Entries should be in some way or other related to all things neuroscience (deep learning, or other topics directly relevant to the NMA CN and DL courses) or climatescience. Irrelevant entries might not be considered. 
Entries in any manner should NOT convey personal opinions or debatable, controversial issues and should STRICTLY be school-appropriate. (For example, no politics, please!)

The winners will be decided based on voting. 

### For the illustrations, pod design and T-shirt contests,

Transparent background looks great.
